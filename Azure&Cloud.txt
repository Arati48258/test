Microsoft Azure 
-----------------------
Azure speed - 150mb/s
	Why?
		Onpremise data centers?
		Cons: 		
			-Infrastructure cost
			-Backup
			-Diaster recovery
			- Security and compliance	
			-Scaling (time for scaling is high)
			- Global reach (lattancy)

		-Cloud
			-Pooled resources
			-Security and Copliance is built-in
			-built-in Backup
			-DR as a service
			-Scale in seconds
			-Global reach and georeplication
			-Pay per Use(pay as you go)
			-automatic monitorin and auditing (alerts)



	What?
		-Cloud is as set of interconnected datacenters with pool of resources that can be accesible over internet.
		-Cloud Types:-
			-Private:-Cisco, HP
			-Public :-Azure, AWS, google Cloud
			-Hybrid
		-Cloud Service Models:-
			-IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service:
			    -Cloud vendor is providing infra such as network,virtual machine(computer), storage (disk),firewall , IP address
			    -IT pro (Admin) will be using  such services.

			-PassS -Platform as Service:
			      -Preconfigured Platform
			      -Developers

			-SaaS   -Software as Service:
			       -Software as a Service
			       -Office 365,dyanmic CRM,One Drive,GoogleDrive,Gmail,Skype
				
	How?
	          Microsoft Azure
		-->Data Center/Regions/Location
		       -54+ Regions
		       -India we have 3 data center: South,Central and West
			-South- Chennai
			-West- Mumbai
			-Central - Pune
		       -Other DataCenters
			-US- EastUS , East Us2 , West Us, South Central Us
			-Brazil, SouthEast Asia (Singapore),East Asia (Hongkong)
			-Azure has datacenters in China, but they are accesaible to only to chinese
			-Germamy ,US Governmnet

		-->Subscriptions
			-Agreement Between customer and microsoft.
			-Subscription Types:
				-Pay As You Go
				-Enterprise agreement
				-free subscriptions:
					-Free trail
					-Recurring subscriptions (for Microsoft certified peoples)

		-Deployment Model
			- Azure Resource Manager Model (ARM Model) 
		     	-Resouce Group
				-Logical grouping of one or more services.
		-How to work with Azure?

-Storage account:
	-one of the primary storage sevices in Azure
	-Storage option in storage account:
		-Blob storage:
			-Used for storing unstructured blob files such as audio, vedio, 
			 images, text files,documents, execuatables etc.
		-File share:
			-Similar to Blob Services.
			-It uses an SMB 3.0 protocol to map the fileshare as a netowrk
			 drive in our personal machine.
		-Queue
			-Is used to implement app-app integration uding text.,messages
			-supports message based communucation.
			=one to many messaging with offline communication feature.
			-one message size is maximum  64 KB(SB Queue meesages can have 
			 up to 256 kb)
			-TTL for message 7 days (SB queue TTL is 14 days)
			-FIFO is not guranteed (SB queue FIFO is guranted)
			-Partitionating of message is not possible (SB queue support it)
		-Table 
			-NoSQL data storage in storage account.
			-store the data in key-value pair format.
			-Every record (entry) is called as entity.
			-Every entity must have a RowKey and Partitionkey.
			-Every entity will have a Timestamp value also.
			-One entity can have maximumof 256 attributes (keys)
				-256-3=253 keys
			

-storage account:(they store 500 TB)
	-v1
		-Performance:Standard+Premimum
		-Access tier:not available
		-All 4 services models available  (Blob+ file + queue+ Table)
	-Blob
		-performance:only standard is availble
		-Access tier:Hot and Cool available
		-only blob  is available
	-v2
		-
-Replication
	-LRS-Locally redundant(low cost)
	-ZRS-zone redundant
	-GRS-Geo Replication
	-RA-GRS-read access (High Cost)
-Blob
	-container-Root Storage place
	-container access policy
		-Blob
			-You can anonymously access files (blob) with out any key
			 or token
			-Use the file URL to access it
			-Url:https://<storageaccname>.blob.core.windows.net/<containers>/<file>
			-Directory browsing is not allowed.
		-Container
			-You can anonymously access files (blob) with out any key or token
			-blob listing (Directory Browsing ) is supported
		-private
			-anonymous access not allowed
			-Need an access token to acces files
			-It ias an secure than other modes
